Technologies used were as follows:

This game uses various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements to test a user and 
then render a number correct with an image of various Supreme Court justices. 

My approach was as follows:
  1. Sketched design 
  2. Review best practices by watching YouTube videos on approaches to design 
  3. Research how to make the answers checked correctly 
  4. I wanted a timer to make my game special so I developed a function to call a timer on load
  
  
Contributions:

I would like the timer to not restart once it runs out. I'd like it close the quiz.
